Stretch Challenge

Build a mini inventory/reporting system that:

Stores devices in a list: ["R1", "R2", "SW1", "SW2", "FW1"].

Uses a dict to map each device to both an IP address and a role (router, switch, firewall).

Example: {"R1": {"ip": "10.0.0.1", "role": "router"}}.

Uses sets to compare required VLANs {10, 20, 30, 40} against configured VLANs for each switch (SW1, SW2).

Example: SW1 has {10, 20, 30}, SW2 has {10, 20, 40}.

Prints a clean report:

Device name, role, and IP.

For switches â†’ list missing VLANs.
